title: 3D Modelling a Joystick
---

The joystick from your Xbox controller is made of 12 individual parts! To teach myself 3D modelling I've copied the design, with painstaking  detail, with Fusion 360. Check my model out [on thinkgyverse][thing] or this animation:

I've modeled the parts to 0.1 mm precision to test out the digital caliper I just bought. As well as to fit it in a spider bot I'm designing the joystick will allow for 2 degrees of freedom as well feedback joint measurements to train a walking neural net.

The joystick also uses a button and 2 potentiometers. Turns out even these guys are a lot more complex than they look:
