Redesigned the hand to use different potentiometers. Initially ordered 3mm sized trim-pots which I realized
were absolutely tiny when they arrived. Un-burdened by any foresight, I went ahead and redesigned the finger
to use them, and got a pretty compact design. Unfortunately the pots, besides being tiny are also super fragile,
and they kept breaking down the middle when I was trying to mount them. Not surprising since I was using a fair
bit of force so that the parts snap into a nice pivot. Alas, I gave up on that after the 3rd one that broke.

After more searching I found other cheap trim-pots that are 6mm wide. More manageable, but the spec sheet says
they only hold out for 20 cycles. Which is like 1 minute of hand use, so I went for more expensive Piher PT6 pots.
These have a hex hole in the middle which allows for a much sturdier construction by using a hex rod as the pivot
point instead of plastic snap-ins. Hex rods are also apparently impossible to buy, but I've settled for chopping
up the appropriately sized hex key.

Finished finger re-iteration using the Piher pots, and it looks much sturdier than both other versions. It's
significantly smaller than the original version, but I think it would beat it in sturdiness. It's also a lot
easier to print, with all parts having enough surface area to adhere to the bed. Nothing too tiny, and no
stress points that make the parts curl up during printing. I need to await the hex rods to finish a prototype!
