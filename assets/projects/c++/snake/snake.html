		<h2>Snake</h2>
		<a href="snake.zip">Download</a>
		<p>My first game made with c++ and <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org">SFML</a>. I was inspired by the classic game and tried to make a similar one as well as developing a little game engine. In 2 weeks I did it and the only similarities between my game and the classic one is that it has a snake.</p> 
		<p>There are 3 characters a snake, a spider and worms. The snake moves around in its miniworld trying to eat as many worms as he can, the more worms he eats the more he grows. Ocassionally he falls in one of the worms' tunnels and gets dizzy. He must be aware of the dangeorous spider webs as any movement in them will attract the venomous spider.</p>
