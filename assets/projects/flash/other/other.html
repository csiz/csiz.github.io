		<h2>Birds' poo</h2>
		<a href="pasari.zip">Download</a>
		<p>A little simulations I made to ilustrate how probable a bird is too poo on you. I did calculate a formula and presuming that birds poo every hour and one passes over you every day than you are to be hit by falling poo at 60 years of age. After seeing that my parrot does his business about every 10 minutes than that figure isn't quite acurate.</p>
