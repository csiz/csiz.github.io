I'm a software and mechatronics engineer, working on useful walking, dextrous robots.

Company website: [Hex-Robotics]

I graduated from Oxford University, worked a few years as a researcher/developer at a hedge fund ([OxAM]), and now I'm studying deep learning in the US. My ongoing project is to design, build and program a walking handy robot.
